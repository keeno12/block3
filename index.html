        <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
        <p>To be a hub where today's blockchain innovators change the world and tomorrow's learn to refine it.</p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>WiFi, desks, and coffee are not enough.

            We are building a community driven by common intellectual ground and the commingling of individuals uniquely equipped to help solve specific problems. 
            
            What success looks like: enterprise and startup teams white-boarding together, developers in the classroom leveling up their game, and investors strategizing with their portfolio companies.</p>
